    <h1>H<sub>2</sub>O in blood</h1>
    <p>It was a dark and cold night, on the <i>4 <sup>th</sup> of September 1983.
</i> <q>As I was walking down a lone and misty road after getting into a huge fight with my bff Harry, 
over some stupid hairless stinky smelly cat that nobody loved. What were they feeding him anyway? All 
I could think was <cite>That guy Harry's a jerk!</cite> As I walked and thought on Harry and his hairless smelly 
cat, I turned my face was into a twisted rage of fury. All I wanted to do was take it out on something, 
anything. Then I saw it, a rock! I thought of my <ins>glory</ins> <del>days</del> as the star forward on my soccor team in Scottsdale. 
No one could kick a ball harder and futher than I could. I got ready, and kicked that rock so hard it sailed 
accross the ground. I laughed as it took flight over the blur of objects it flew over. My giggling frenzy came 
to an abrupt stop when it launched through a car window, setting off the car alarm. I paniced and ran the other way. 
This brought me back to my track and field days. No one could run faster and futher than I could. I ran like the wind. </q></p>
    <p>Ironically, as I was attempting to get away, I tripped on a rock and fell to my knees. After I collected myself, 
I noticed text on the ground in a dark crimson color.</p>
    <p>As I looked closer there was text I recall learning in 12<sup>th</sup> grade chemistry. 
It was <br/> the <b><i>symbol</b></i> H<sub>2</sub>O written on the ground - in blood!</p>
    <p>"Blood?" I asked myself. I had so many questions: 
    <ul>
    	<li>Who's blood was it?</li>
    	<li>Why was the symbol <i>H<sub>2</sub>O</i> written in blood?</li>
    	<li>Should I call the police?</li>
    </ul><hr>Questions like these <dfn>kept running through my</dfn> mind.</p>
<p> I wanted to contact <acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</acronym> for any information that
they would possibly have. After contacting NASA, they said I'd have to send a telegram to <abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking for more
information on that <i><q>particular subject.</q></i></p> A month later I received a telegram from <abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Stephen Hawking that said,
<br/><br/><q>Mr. Knowles, thank you so much for reaching out to me. Many have erred in contacting NASA for information similar to what you seek. Silly them, 
and silly you young man. Clearly you would have saved so much time by contacting me via text message, this is in fact <i>2016</i> you idiot! Anyway,
To find out the informaiton you seek you must first break down the <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>. This alone would be an outstanding achievement.
After you break down the DNA, don't send me a telegram, text me at 555-555-5555. <br/> <br/>-Hawking.</q>
